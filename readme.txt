This Unity project is meant to be used in conjunction with webthing-python-unity repository on my github.

Git commit this repository and open it in Unity.

Run the webthing-python-unity code and determine the computers ip address that is running the python code.

Go to the IoT proxy manager and change the ip address to the ip address that you found.

Then run the code and you should see the gameobjects in unity show up as IoT devices in mozillas gateway.

When they are turned on and off the color will swap from green to red in unity.

New devices can be added using the same structure of the existing gameobjects.
