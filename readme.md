# This Repository
Is a Unity3D project that can be used as a template to create virtual IoT devices are visable and addable by a Mozilla IoT router when used in conjunction with this [repository](https://github.com/gatordevin/webthing-python-unity).
# Why?
  The purpose of this project was to enable virtual objects such as a virtual ligh switch to dynamically interact with real world smart device through rules created on the [Mozilla IoT router gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/). 
  This has potential in AR and VR applications where the goal is to intertwine the real world and the virtual world. In this case it was used for a robotics competition to allow users wearing a [MagicLeap AR headset](https://www.magicleap.com/) to interact with real gameobjects and also to add visual effects to the headset when certain events happen in the [RDL](https://tech-garage.org/robot-drone-league/) game.
